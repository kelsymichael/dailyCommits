### 2015-04-01 - w01d03 - Wed

Starting to work on html2 - first layout, starting over && attempting to use flexbox.

	*to use font-weight, add '-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;' after it.

// flexbox looked terrible, realized i was missing a closing bracket on my div in the header section. note-to-self, check html when things go wonky.

update @ 2:30pm
	my mind has turned to shit

				^note from third layout. 
					Used a fixed height on .box, but set width to 100%
					Set another container for the box within a child :e.g.,
					p = parent, c = child, gc = grandchild, gcc = great-gc
						p container d:flex
						 c col1
						 c col2
							gc .boxc d:flex justify-content center align-items center
								ggc .box width 100% height 250px

// sidenote - use following tag '<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"> '

		
// my last note to use flex within a flex would have been useful

		for some reason i've been looking at my monitor and not making the simple adjustment for all img's to be within their own space, justify-content space-between

##setup with flex box, %, and fixed with media queries
