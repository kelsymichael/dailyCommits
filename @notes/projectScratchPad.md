Starting to work on html2 - first layout, starting over && attempting to use flexbox.

	*to use font-weight, add '-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;' after it.

// flexbox looked terrible, realized i was missing a closing bracket on my div in the header section. note-to-self, check html when things go wonky.

update @ 2:30pm
	my mind has turned to shit
